## Business Communication
### Evidence

https://github.com/ZintleMgqongose/ZintleMgqongose/blob/main/Business_Communication.png


### Reflection

Situation: When I started the module, my professional communication often lacked clarity and structure. My emails and contributions in meetings were sometimes informal or vague, which caused confusion and reduced the perceived professionalism of my interactions. I also found it challenging to begin emails correctly, including using the proper greetings and honorifics.

Task: I aimed to improve my ability to select an appropriate tone, write concise and professional emails, and present information effectively in both virtual and in-person settings. I wanted to communicate confidently without sounding overly rigid or impersonal.

Action: I completed the Business Communication lessons in the Work Readiness module. I studied email formatting‚Äîsubject line, greeting, body, and closing‚Äîand practiced transforming casual messages into professional ones. I adhered to style guidelines, ensuring proper grammar, suitable sign-offs, and clear subject lines. Additionally, I rehearsed speaking points for meetings and practiced delivering messages neutrally and professionally, including constructive feedback.

Result: I now craft emails that are clear, well-structured, and audience-appropriate. In group projects and presentations, my communication is more precise, reducing misunderstandings and improving collaboration. These improvements have enhanced the clarity of task instructions and strengthened my overall professional presence.

## Interview Skills
### Evidence
https://github.com/ZintleMgqongose/ZintleMgqongose/blob/main/Interview_Skills.png

### Reflection
Situation: I used to feel anxious during interviews. Although I understood the technical aspects, I struggled to present my examples effectively, especially for behavioral questions. I often went off-topic or neglected to include the outcomes, which weakened my responses.

Task: My goal was to prepare for interviews more effectively by crafting concise examples using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method, refining my introduction, and practicing my professional appearance and tone.

Action: I participated in the Interview Skills lessons, identified common technical and behavioral questions, and created STAR responses for my top eight scenarios, including team conflict, deadline pressure, technical challenges, and leadership experiences. I practiced these responses aloud and developed a 60-second elevator pitch that summarized my skills and projects. Additionally, I recorded mock answers to assess my pacing and clarity.

Result: Now, I deliver structured responses that focus on outcomes and measurable results. My confidence has grown, allowing me to address behavioral questions with fewer fillers and a stronger emphasis on impact. Interviewers now have a clear insight into my problem-solving methods and contributions.

## Mock Interview
### Evidence

### Reflection
Situation: The thought of participating in a live mock interview was quite intimidating. I worried about how I would perform under pressure and whether I could turn my rehearsed answers into a genuine conversation. I also felt I needed feedback on my non-verbal communication.

Task: My goal was to replicate a real interview setting to assess my communication skills, body language, and my ability to answer both technical and behavioral questions while under time constraints. I was looking for practical feedback to help me improve.

Action: I took part in a timed mock interview that included both behavioral and technical rounds. During the interview, I focused on maintaining good posture, making eye contact, managing my breathing, and delivering concise STAR responses. Afterward, I sought feedback from the interviewer on the clarity of my answers, the relevance of my examples, and my tone. I used this feedback to refine my responses and practiced follow-up questions to enhance my conversational style.

Result: The mock interview significantly reduced my anxiety and highlighted subtle habits, like using filler words and rushing my conclusions. With the feedback I received, I was able to enhance my STAR examples by including clearer metrics and insights. Now, my overall interview presence is more balanced‚Äîprepared yet relaxed‚Äîand I can easily shift from technical specifics to a broader impact when necessary.

## Professional Networking
### Evidence

https://github.com/ZintleMgqongose/ZintleMgqongose/blob/main/Professional_Networking.png

### Reflection

Situation: I had very little experience with professional networking and didn‚Äôt have a consistent or polished online presence. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to approach professionals in my field or how to present my work credibly on platforms like LinkedIn.

Task: My aim was to create a strong and professional online image, learn how to reach out to people in my industry effectively, and develop proper networking habits such as writing personalized messages, following up respectfully, and offering value in my interactions.

Action: I completed the Professional Networking training, revamped my LinkedIn profile to highlight my key projects and responsibilities, and crafted a personalized message template for connection requests. I also joined professional groups, followed thought leaders, and interacted regularly with posts by commenting and sharing relevant content to stay visible and engaged. Additionally, I practiced holding informational conversations to confidently connect with professionals.

Result: Today, my LinkedIn profile clearly reflects my technical strengths and achievements. I‚Äôve expanded my network by connecting with classmates and professionals in the field, and I now understand how to build and maintain relationships through meaningful, value-focused communication. Networking has become an intentional and rewarding part of my career growth rather than something I avoided.

## Workplace Etiquette
### Evidence

https://github.com/ZintleMgqongose/ZintleMgqongose/blob/main/Workplace_Etiquette.png

### Reflection

Situation: Entering the workplace with only limited experience from my first qualification was already a challenge, but it became even more difficult after COVID-19 changed many professional norms. Remote work, virtual meetings, and new communication styles made it unclear what behaviours were now expected, from punctuality in online settings to professional etiquette in hybrid environments. I wanted to adapt and make a good impression despite these changes.

Task: My objective was to understand modern workplace expectations after COVID-19, including professional appearance (both in-person and online), punctuality, clear and respectful digital communication, confidentiality, teamwork, and conflict resolution in virtual or hybrid settings.

Action: I completed the Workplace Etiquette lessons, participated in group projects (both online and in person) to apply these behaviours, and sought feedback from peers about my communication and reliability. I also developed a personal checklist to stay professional in any setting ‚Äî such as preparing for virtual meetings, managing time zones, responding promptly, and keeping written records of key discussions.

Result: I now confidently meet post-COVID workplace expectations. I communicate effectively across digital platforms, maintain professionalism in hybrid environments, and manage time and responsibilities responsibly. These habits have improved collaboration, strengthened trust with teammates, and helped me adjust to the evolving modern workplace.
