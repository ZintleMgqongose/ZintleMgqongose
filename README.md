### Reflection

Situation: At the beginning of this course, I felt completely lost about my career path, unsure if I had made the right choice. I struggled to understand my identity and how I would fit into my chosen field.

Task: My goal was to determine whether I truly belonged in this career or if I had rushed into becoming a software developer.

Action: I committed to exploring my self-identity, using that knowledge to shape my career and develop a comprehensive career plan.

Result: Through this process, I uncovered my strengths and gained clarity on my initial motivations for choosing this path. I realized that I enjoy designing solutions and solving problems that benefit others. My career objective is to help people and advance to a lead developer role, where I can support my team members effectively.
